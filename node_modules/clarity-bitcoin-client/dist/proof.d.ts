 * and adds it to the proof, with its direction (left or right)
 * then it calculates the position of the next node in the next level, by
 * dividing the child index by 2, so this new index can be used in the next iteration of the
 * loop, along with the level.
 * If we check the result of this representation of the Merkle tree, we notice that
 * The first level has all the hashes, an even number of hashes.
 * All the levels have an even number of hashes, except the last one (since is the
 * Merkle root)
 * The next level have half or less hashes than the previous level, which allows us
 * to find the hash associated with the index of a previous hash in the next level in constant time.
 * Then we simply return this Merkle proof.
